# TMDL Inspector - VS Code Extension

## Overview/Goals

TMDL Inspector is a VS Code extension designed to help developers understand and visualize the dependencies within their Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) projects. The goal is to improve productivity, facilitate collaboration, and enhance the maintainability of tabular models defined in TMDL.

## Key Features

* Scan a folder for TMDL files.
* Parse TMDL files and identify model objects.
* Analyze dependencies between TMDL objects (relationships, measure dependencies, etc.).
* Visualize the dependency graph in an interactive WebView.
* Display details of selected TMDL objects and their dependencies.
* Allow searching for specific TMDL objects.
* Provide basic impact analysis capabilities.
* Report syntax errors and inconsistencies in TMDL files.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Future Considerations/Nice-to-Haves

* More advanced impact analysis (e.g., multi-level dependencies).
* Filtering the dependency graph by object type and dependency type.
* Customizable graph styling and appearance.
* Exporting the dependency graph as an image or other format.
* Integration with version control systems to show changes in dependencies over time.

## Out of Scope

* Editing or modifying TMDL files directly within the visualization.
* Support for older versions of Tabular Models (below compatibility level 1200).
* Full compatibility with the entire Tabular Object Model (TOM) API beyond dependency analysis.

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
